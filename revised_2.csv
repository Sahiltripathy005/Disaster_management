Firebreaks
"In response to the severe flooding in Mumbai in July 2005, the city faced an increased risk of fire outbreaks due to waterlogged electrical systems and damaged infrastructure. To address this, the Mumbai Fire Brigade implemented firebreaks in the aftermath of the floods.

The floods on July 26, 2005, resulted in approximately 300 deaths and around 1,000 injuries, but specific numbers related to firebreaks are not detailed."
"In 2019, the Deccan Plateau region took measures to prevent wildfires by establishing firebreaks. These firebreaks were intended to create controlled gaps in vegetation to halt the spread of fires during the dry season. Specific details about the length of firebreaks and their direct impact on deaths and injuries are not available, as the focus was primarily on wildfire management rather than on recording related casualties."
"During the wildfire season in the Himalayan foothills in 2020, firebreaks were created to manage and control fires threatening forested areas and rural communities.

The primary aim was to protect sensitive ecosystems and local communities from wildfires."
"In Rajasthan, firebreaks were implemented in 2021 to address wildfire risks during the dry season. These firebreaks involved creating fire-resistant barriers and conducting controlled burns over several thousand hectares. Although precise figures for deaths and injuries related to these firebreaks are not provided, the strategy was essential for preventing the spread of fires in the arid landscape. The effort aimed to protect natural habitats and human settlements from potential wildfire damage."
